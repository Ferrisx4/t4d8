Pages and Page Types
=======================

In Drupal terminology, each Tripal content page is an content entity (e.g. MyFavGene-1) and each Tripal Content Type (e.g. Genes) is a configuration entity. Tripal core has already done the work of defining these to Drupal and creates a number of common content types on install.
