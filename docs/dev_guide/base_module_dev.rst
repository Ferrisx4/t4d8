Custom Module Development
============================

`Tripal <https://tripal.info>`_ is an extension of the `Drupal Content Management System <https://www.drupal.org/>`_. Drupal 8 is written in PHP, very object oriented and uses technology standards such as `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_, `Symphony <https://symfony.com/>`_, `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ and `Twig <https://twig.symfony.com/>`_. This tutorial is meant to act as an orientation to Tripal development in Drupal 8 and will link to additional Drupal-specific tutorials for specific topics.
